# Pylint_GUI
(Author:HRITIK BHAT)

Pylint is a source-code, bug and quality checker for the Python programming language. It follows the style recommended by PEP 8, the Python style guide.

But writing commands is irritating sometimes,so I have made it in GUI form so that anyone can access it without writing commands in CMD.

IT WORKS FOR WINDOWS FOR NOW!

Have FUN!!! ;)
